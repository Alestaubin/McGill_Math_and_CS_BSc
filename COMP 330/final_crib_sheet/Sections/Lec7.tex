\subsection{\color{ForestGreen}Context Free Grammars}
\subsubsection{Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textbf{Context Free Grammar} is a notation for describing languages that is more powerful than finite automata.
    \item Terminals = symbols of the alphabet of the language being defined.
    \item Variables = nonterminals = a finite set of other symbols, each of which represents a language.
    \item Start symbol = the variable whose language is the one being defined.
    \item A production has the form variable $\rightarrow{}$ string of variables and terminals.
    \item $=>^* $ means "zero or more derivation steps."
    \item $\alpha$ is a \textbf{sentential form} $\iff S =>^* \alpha.$ 
    \item A language that is defined by some CFG is called a \textbf{context-free language}. Intuition: CFL's can count 2 things, not 3.
    \item Leftmost and Rightmost derivations: A leftmost derivation is one in which you always expand the leftmost non-terminal, denoted as $=>_{lm}^*$.
\end{itemize}
